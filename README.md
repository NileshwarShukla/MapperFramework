# MapperFramework
The framework supports feature of mapping of one entity to another. It needs a source entity, a target entity and mapping defined in JSON file.
The mapping can be done by following ways:-

•	Ref : Using direct reference of parent entity.

•	Offset: Referring to parent entity with some offset value.

•	Hook: Refering to custom method which resolves the mapping value.
